##  Project Overview
The goal of this project is to build predictive models that can assist in:
- Patient risk prediction (e.g., disease likelihood, readmission risk).
- Identifying trends in health metrics.
- Improving patient care and optimizing healthcare resources.
- Providing explainable predictions that help healthcare professionals trust and use the model effectively.

##  Features
- **Data Preprocessing & Cleaning** → handle missing values, outliers, and categorical encoding.  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** → visualize trends, correlations, and health patterns.  
- **Predictive Modeling** → Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Neural Networks.  
- **Model Optimization** → Hyperparameter tuning (Grid Search, Random Search).  
- **Explainable AI (XAI)** → SHAP/LIME to explain model predictions.  
- **Interactive Dashboard** → visual interface for exploring health trends and prediction outputs.  
- **Deployment** → model exposed as REST API (Flask/FastAPI).  
- **Monitoring & Reporting** → track model performance over time.
